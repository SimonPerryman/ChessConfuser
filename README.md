# Chess Confuser

Have you ever wanted to challenge yourself further in your chess game, or simply plunge yourself into pure anarchy?

Look no further, as this is the extension for you! Chess confuser is a Google Chrome extension that scrambles the pieces on the chess board in order to challenge you, or to increase the randomness in your games!

**If any bug occurs that is negatively affecting your game, simply turn off the chess scrambler using the menu and refresh your page.**

## FAQ:
Q. Have you got any examples of the extension working?   
A. Yes, please see some gifs I made [here](https://imgur.com/a/MM4mx1h).

Q. Does this extension work with every chess board and piece styling?   
A. I have yet to test every style, however I am confident that it should work with every one. The only styles that I need to test and am not 100% confident about are the 3D styles.

Q. How do I turn the scrambling off?   
A. You can turn the scrambling off either by hitting the reset button, or toggling the "Chess Confuser" (extension on/off) button in the pop up menu. The pop up menu is brought up by clicking on the extension button.

Q. What do the different settings mean?   
A. Please refer to the [settings section](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#settings) to read about the different settings available.

Q. What are the different gamemodes of the extension?   
A. Please refer to the [gamemodes section](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#gamemodes) to read about the different gamemodes available.

Q. What chess.com modes can I use the extension on?   
A. Chess confuser is designed only to work when you are playing against another human, a computer and on the analysis board. This means it will not work on puzzle rush, puzzle battle, learning, or any other gamemode. This is an intended feature.

Q. How can I report a bug?   
A. You can find out how to report bugs [here](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#reporting-bugs).

Q. Are you affiliated with chess.com?

## Settings

There are a number of settings options available:
1. [Number of rotations](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#number-of-rotations)
2. [White Rotation](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#white-rotation)
3. [Black Rotation](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#black-rotation)
4. [Legal Move Helper](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#legal-move-helper)

### Number of Rotations

The scrambling works by swapping (rotating) two pieces images. This setting defines how many swaps you wish to do per scramble. Please note that this is for *either side* therefore having 10 scrambles means the white pieces will get scrambled 10 times, and the black pieces will also get scrambled 10 times. Currently the minimum number of rotations is 1, and the maximum is 30.

### White Rotation

This is a toggle which will turn on/off the white pieces being scrambled. It is used if you only want one sides pieces to be scrambled.

### Black Rotation

This is a toggle which will turn on/off the black pieces being scrambled. It is used if you only want one sides pieces to be scrambled.

### Legal Move Helper

On chess.com, there is a legal move helper, which shows which squares your piece is able to move to when you click on the piece. This setting allows you to turn off the legal move helper. If you do not turn it off, although your pawn might have the appearance of a knight, it becomes more obvious that it is a pawn if you click on it. You can also turn this legal move helper off officially on chess.com's website settings.

## Gamemodes

There are a few gamemodes that are to be developed for the extension:
1. [Sneaky Mode](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#sneaky-mode)
2. [Constant Rotations](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#constant-rotations)
3. [Kings and Queens Rotated](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#kings-and-queens-rotated)
4. [Distractions](https://github.com/simonperryman/chessconfuser/blob/master/README.md#distractions)
